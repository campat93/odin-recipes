<h4>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</h4>

<p>A standard recipe for crêpe calls for flour, eggs, milk, and salt. Sugar is optional. Beer can substitute for some of the milk. Buckwheat flour is often used for recipes. The batter is added, one ladle at a time, to a hot greased pan, and cooked until golden, then flipped.</p>

<p>Originally, crêpes came from Brittany in France, where they originated in the 13th century. Today, they can be found all over the world.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
